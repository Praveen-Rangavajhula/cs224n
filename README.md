# CS224N Notes & Assignments

This repository is for my **self-education** while following Stanford’s **CS224N: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning** course. I'm watching the lectures from the [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rOaMFbaqxPDoLWjDaRAdP9D) and solving the **Winter 2025** assignments from the [official course page](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/index.html#schedule).

I'll also be adding my own **notes** from the lectures as I go. If you’re interested in those, stay tuned.

## Repo Structure
- **`main` branch** → Contains lecture notes and assignments (without solutions).
- **`cs224n-solutions` branch** → Contains solutions for the assignments I’ve completed so far.

This setup lets me reattempt assignments without immediately seeing my past solutions.  
If you're following along, **I strongly encourage you to first try solving the assignments on your own** 
before checking any solutions. Stick to `main`, create your own branch, 
and give it a shot before comparing with my answers.

## Assignment Progress
- **Assignment 1** – Exploring Word Vectors ✅ (Completed)  
- **Assignment 2** – Word2Vec and Dependency Parsing ✅ (Completed)  
- **Assignment 3** – Neural Machine Translation & Analysis ✅ (Completed)  
- **Assignment 4** – TBD ⏳ (Not Started)
